# SpringBank

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a Spring Boot REST API for managing a small banking system. The web interface team has completed the framing/design phase in collaboration with the developer. The goal is to implement the REST API according to the specifications outlined in the service contract.
Project Scope

The banking system can manage clients, their accounts, and transactions. Key features include:

- Detailed client information: name, age, contact details, etc.
- Clients associated with a bank code and branch/agency code.
- Accounts with balances, identified by IBAN.
- Joint accounts with multiple holders in the same branch.
- Bank cards associated with accounts, with specific rules for debit and credit.
- Transfers between accounts with execution dates and beneficiary details.
